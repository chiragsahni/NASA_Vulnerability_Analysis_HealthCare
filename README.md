# NASA_Vulnerability_Analysis_HealthCare
Ranking the health care facilities of the USA based on their vulnerability against extreme precipitation.

Identified the most impacted facilities with respect to amounts of past precipitation and ranked these facilities in order of their vulnerability against extreme precipitation.

Keeping in mind and concentrating on the recent unusual climatic activity of 2021 Texas floods in the USA, for now I decided to narrow down my work and divert my center of attention to the following three South Western states:
 
      i. Oklahoma
     ii. Texas
    iii. Arizona


## Datasets Involved

### 1. Health Care Facilities data by Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)
          i. Hospitals
         ii. Urgent Care Facilities
        iii. Pharmacies
        
### 2. Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Data from NASA
          i. Monthly Global Precipitation Data
          
 
Currently, I have considered the complete HIFLD data available but have considered two major filters for the NASA GPM data, which are:

1.	Carried out analysis for only three (Oklahoma, Texas and Arizona) of the USA states. I plan to extend this analysis to all 50 states of the USA.
2.	For now, worked on the monthly precipitation data but this project has scope to use the daily and half-hourly precipitation data as well for better accuracy of the rankings.

Hence, going forward I will work on the above-mentioned enhancements for the better scope and reach of the project.
